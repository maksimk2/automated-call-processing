## 🧪 `demo/` – Internal Demo Version

> ⚠️ Intended **only for internal demo purposes**, not for customer distribution.

This version demonstrates the **end-to-end analytics capabilities at scale**, simulating transcription output to:
- Showcase AI enrichment (sentiment, NER, classification, summarization)
- Visualize patterns across **larger volumes of call data**
- Power the **front-end dashboard** with meaningful insights

### 🔧 Key Notes:
- Includes **sample audio files** in the Bronze layer.
- Uses **`resources/generate_data.py`** to create a **Silver layer** with **simulated transcriptions**.
- Supports **bulk application** of Databricks AI Functions (sentiment, summarization, topic classification, etc.).
- Ideal for **live demos** and showcasing **dashboard interactivity**.

### 🧩 Use Case:
Great for illustrating how insights scale when applying AI functions across calls in a customer service environment.

## 🤝 `customer/` – Shareable Version

> ✅ This is the version meant to be **shared directly with customers**.

The `customer/` directory contains the **clean version of the solution accelerator**, which:
- Includes **sample `.m4a` audio files** for ingestion
- Walks through the **complete, realistic pipeline**:
  - Bronze Layer: Raw ingestion of audio
  - Silver Layer: Format conversion, duration calculation, transcription using Whisper
  - Gold Layer: AI enrichment via Databricks AI Functions and LLMs

### 🔧 Key Notes:
- No simulated data — all transcriptions are generated from real sample audio using **OpenAI Whisper**.
- Ensures full **transparency and reproducibility**.
- Designed to show **how customers can adopt the pipeline** with their own audio sources and extend the AI use cases.

---

## 🔍 Resources

- `demo/resources/generate_data.py`: Generates simulated transcription data for demo use
- `dashboard.lvdash.json`: Dashboard template for Databricks
- `automated-claims-processing-etl.yaml`: YAML template to create an automated Databricks job
- Notebooks are modular and follow **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**

---

## 🧭 Suggested Usage

| Directory | Audience | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `demo/` | Internal teams | Live demos and showcasing dashboards at scale |
| `customer/` | Customers, prospects | Deployable reference pipeline with real transcription and AI insights |

---

## 📎 Notebooks (Included in Both Versions)

| Notebook | Layer | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `00 ETL Bronze Layer` | Bronze | Ingest raw audio and register file metadata |
| `01 ETL Silver Layer` | Silver | Convert audio, extract metadata, transcribe |
| `02 ETL Gold Layer` | Gold | Apply AI Functions for sentiment, classification, summarization, NER, and generate follow-up emails |

---

## 🎧 Sample Audio Recordings

The repository includes a folder of **sample recordings** located in:

- `raw_recordings/` 

This folder contains **5 sample `.m4a` audio recordings** featuring fictional call center conversations. These files are provided **purely for demo purposes**.

### 📥 Customization:
Users are encouraged to:
- Replace or extend these with their own `.m4a` call recordings.
- Upload their audio files directly into the `raw_recordings` directory of the volume `audio_recordings` once created in the Bronze ingestion step.

This ensures the full ETL and AI pipeline operates on your organisation's own data, providing tailored insights.

---

## 📊 Visualisation

Use the outputs from the Gold layer to power:
- Agent & Manager dashboards
- Sentiment trends
- Fraud alerts
- Case summaries and auto-generated follow-up communications

---

## 📊 Dashboard JSON Template

A sample **Databricks dashboard JSON** is included in this repository for quick deployment of visualizations powered by the Gold Layer data.

### 📄 File:
- `dashboard.json`

### 📝 Instructions:
- Import this JSON into your Databricks workspace using the dashboard import UI.
- After import, **update the SQL `SELECT` statements** in the *Data* section of each dashboard tile to point to your actual schema and table (e.g., `samantha_wise.ai_claims_processing_clean.analysis_gold`).
- Ensure you have permission to access the underlying Delta tables via Unity Catalog.

> ⚠️ Note: This JSON is a template. It assumes table names and paths consistent with this accelerator. If you modified the table names or schema paths, you'll need to adjust the SQL accordingly after import.

## ⚙️ Automating the Pipeline with a Databricks Job

To run the full notebook pipeline automatically when new audio files arrive, you can use the provided **Databricks Job YAML template**.

### 📄 File:
- `resources/job_template.yaml`

### 📝 Instructions:
1. Use this template as a starting point to configure a Databricks Job in your workspace.
2. **Update the following placeholders** with your own environment parameters:
   - `<CATALOG>`, `<SCHEMA>`, `<VOLUME>` – Your Unity Catalog paths
   - `<USERNAME>` – Your workspace email path (used in notebook paths)
   - `<CLUSTER_ID>` – Your existing compute cluster ID
   - `<SQL_WAREHOUSE_ID>` – ID of your SQL warehouse (for dashboard refresh)
   - `<DASHBOARD_ID>` – ID of your dashboard

3. This job will:
   - Trigger when a new file lands in `raw_recordings/`
   - Run the Bronze → Silver → Gold notebooks sequentially
   - Optionally refresh a dashboard after pipeline completion

> ⚠️ This is a template. Users must replace all placeholders before deployment.
